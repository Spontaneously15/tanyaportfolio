    <h1>CRM Systems</h1>
    <p>
      CRM tools have been at the core of how I manage people, projects, and processes. I’ve worked with CRM platforms both in academic roles and digital marketing internships, and I’ve seen firsthand how they streamline communication and enhance productivity.
      <br><br>
      During my role as a Graduate Coordinator at Montclair State University, I used CRM systems to track student progress, coordinate tutor schedules, and resolve support queries — all while maintaining strong communication across the team.
      <br><br>
      In my SEO and digital marketing work, CRM tools helped me organize outreach campaigns, manage leads, and align marketing strategies with audience insights.
      <br><br>
      I’m confident using CRM features like contact segmentation, activity logging, automated reminders, and performance tracking — and I’m continuing to explore how CRM integrations can elevate overall marketing workflows.
