    <h1>Google Search Console</h1>
    <p>
      Google Search Console has been one of the most insightful tools in my SEO workflow. I've used it regularly to monitor site performance, identify indexing issues, analyze search queries, and optimize for better visibility on Google.
      <br><br>
      During my work with websites like <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong>, <strong>Zedplus Accounting & Finance</strong>, and <strong>Performance Max</strong>, I leveraged Search Console to track impressions, clicks, CTRs, and keyword rankings. These insights helped me fine-tune on-page strategies, fix crawl errors, and submit sitemaps to improve overall SEO health.
      <br><br>
      I especially enjoy using the performance and URL inspection tools to understand what content Google is prioritizing, and how to continuously improve the site's presence on search results.
