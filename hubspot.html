    <h1>HubSpot</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve worked with HubSpot as part of my digital marketing and content strategy roles, and I really appreciate how user-friendly and powerful it is for managing campaigns, leads, and customer relationships.
      <br><br>
      I’ve used HubSpot for:
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 15px;">
        <li>📩 Creating and managing email campaigns</li>
        <li>🗂️ Segmenting contacts and lists</li>
        <li>📈 Tracking user engagement and performance analytics</li>
        <li>✍️ Drafting blog posts and scheduling social content</li>
        <li>🔄 Integrating with other tools like Canva and Google Analytics</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      I love how HubSpot ties together multiple marketing efforts into one cohesive system, and I’m always looking to improve my automation, CRM integration, and campaign optimization skills on the platform.
