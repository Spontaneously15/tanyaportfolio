    <h1>Vegas Rapid Rentals</h1>
    <p>
      For Vegas Rapid Rentals, I worked on optimizing content across key landing pages to improve clarity, user engagement, and SEO value. My focus was on refining existing content to make it more keyword-rich, readable, and actionable.
      <br><br>
      I improved title tags, meta descriptions, and body copy, ensuring that they aligned with relevant keywords for local car rental searches in Las Vegas. I also worked on CTAs and formatted the content for better mobile readability.
      <br><br>
      This optimization improved the site’s dwell time and contributed to a noticeable boost in organic traffic and local visibility.
