    <h1>Content Writing</h1>
    <p>
      Content writing has always been one of my strongest and most natural skills. I enjoy crafting meaningful, engaging, and SEO-friendly content that connects with audiences — whether it's for blog posts, landing pages, social media, or internal communication.
      <br><br>
      I’ve written optimized blog articles, meta descriptions, newsletters, and campaign copy for websites like <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong>, <strong>Zedplus Accounting & Finance</strong>, and <strong>Playhouse Preschool</strong>. I’m confident in writing for different tones and formats depending on the brand and goal.
      <br><br>
      My background in SEO makes me especially strong at combining content strategy with keyword research, helping ensure that what I write not only sounds good — but also performs.
