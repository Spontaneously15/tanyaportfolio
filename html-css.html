    <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently in the learning phase of HTML and CSS, and although I’m not yet advanced, I’ve been applying what I know to build and design my personal portfolio website — including the very page you're viewing right now!
      <br><br>
      This hands-on experience has helped me understand how to structure web content using HTML and how to style and enhance user experience using CSS. I've worked with elements like layout grids, flexbox, buttons, and responsive design principles.
      <br><br>
      While I’m still growing in this area, I genuinely enjoy the creativity and control HTML & CSS offer in building something visual and functional. I plan to keep experimenting with different projects to improve my skills and eventually dive deeper into frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.
