    <h1>Adaptability</h1>
    <p>
      I’m someone who embraces change with curiosity and resilience. Whether I’m learning a new tool like Python, adjusting to a new workflow, or handling unexpected challenges — I adapt quickly and stay flexible.
      <br><br>
      My academic and work journey as an international student has taught me how to navigate change, take initiative, and stay calm under pressure. I truly believe adaptability is a strength that helps me grow in any environment.
