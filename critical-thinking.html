    <h1>Critical Thinking</h1>
    <p>
      I approach challenges by thinking analytically, asking meaningful questions, and exploring multiple solutions before taking action. Whether I’m building dashboards or optimizing a marketing funnel, I like to step back and understand the “why” behind decisions.
      <br><br>
      My coursework in data analytics and experience in SEO have sharpened my ability to interpret data, identify patterns, and create strategy based on insights — not assumptions.
