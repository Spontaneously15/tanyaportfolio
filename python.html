    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently a beginner in Python — but that hasn’t stopped me from actively using it in multiple college projects and expanding my comfort zone with it every day.
      <br><br>
      My journey with Python began as part of my Master's program in Business Analytics, where I’ve used it for tasks like data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. I’ve worked with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to bring insights to life from raw datasets.
      <br><br>
      Some of the projects I’ve used Python for include an <strong>Airbnb pricing analysis</strong>, where I cleaned and processed data, created visualizations, and interpreted patterns to help optimize host pricing strategies.
      <br><br>
      I’m continuing to build on this foundation by dedicating time every week to hands-on learning and mini-projects that deepen my understanding of Python in data analytics and digital marketing applications.
      <br><br>
      Learning Python has truly opened my eyes to the power of automation, storytelling with data, and scalability — and I’m excited to keep growing in this space!
