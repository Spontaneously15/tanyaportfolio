    <h1>PowerPoint</h1>
    <p>
      PowerPoint has been one of my go-to tools for both academic and professional presentations. Whether it's training new team members or delivering data-driven insights, I’ve used PowerPoint to communicate ideas clearly and visually.
      <br><br>
      At Montclair State University, I created visually engaging slides for onboarding workshops and internal trainings — combining interactivity with structure to increase engagement and retention.
      <br><br>
      I’ve also used PowerPoint extensively in my college coursework and project presentations, ensuring that key takeaways are easy to understand, impactful, and on-brand.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy using features like animations, infographics, and visual storytelling to craft decks that do more than inform — they leave a lasting impression.
