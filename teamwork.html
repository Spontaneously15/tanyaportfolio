    <h1>Teamwork</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve collaborated with diverse teams in both academic and professional settings — including tutoring centers, marketing teams, and group projects. I enjoy being a supportive team member who communicates well, respects others’ perspectives, and contributes ideas with a positive attitude.
      <br><br>
      I believe teamwork is about shared goals, open communication, and helping each other succeed. I always strive to uplift the group while staying reliable, accountable, and solutions-focused.
