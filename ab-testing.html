    <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
    <p>
      A/B Testing has been an essential part of how I make informed, data-backed decisions in digital marketing. I’ve used it to test and refine various website and content elements — like CTAs, headlines, meta descriptions, and email subject lines.
      <br><br>
      While working on projects like <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong> and <strong>Performance Max</strong>, I ran A/B tests to optimize click-through rates and engagement using real performance data. Tools like Google Optimize, heatmaps, and CTR analysis helped me understand which versions resonated most with users.
      <br><br>
      A/B Testing taught me the importance of experimentation, iteration, and continuous improvement — especially in SEO, content marketing, and user experience strategy.
      <br><br>
      I look forward to using this approach even more in future campaigns to refine marketing efforts and drive better results.
