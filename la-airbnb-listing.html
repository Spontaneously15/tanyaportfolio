    <h1>LA Airbnb Listing Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      In this data project, I analyzed thousands of Airbnb listings in Los Angeles to discover key price drivers and listing patterns.
      <br><br>
      I used <strong>Python</strong> (pandas, matplotlib) for data cleaning and analysis, and <strong>Tableau</strong> for creating dashboards that visualized price trends based on factors like location, reviews, and number of bedrooms.
      <br><br>
      This project helped me practice real-world data handling, and taught me how to combine insights with storytelling to deliver valuable takeaways to hosts and travelers alike.
