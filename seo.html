    <h1>SEO</h1>
    <p>
        SEO has been the foundation of my digital marketing journey — it's the skill I’m most confident in and passionate about. It was the very first area I explored, and since then, I've gained extensive hands-on experience across multiple real-world projects.
      
        <br><br>
      
        Over time, I’ve successfully implemented SEO strategies for a wide variety of websites, including:
        <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong>, <strong>Performance Max</strong>, <strong>Zedplus Accounting & Finance</strong>, <strong>Pyramid Eats</strong>, <strong>Vegas Rapid Rentals</strong>, and <strong>Playhouse Preschool</strong>.
      
        <br><br>
      
        My work included on-page SEO (meta tags, content optimization, internal linking), off-page strategies (backlink building, guest posts), and technical audits using tools like SEMrush and Google Search Console. These efforts significantly improved website visibility, keyword rankings, and organic traffic growth.
