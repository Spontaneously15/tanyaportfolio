    <h1>Communication</h1>
    <p>
      I believe strong communication is the key to effective teamwork and leadership. I’ve developed clear, professional, and empathetic communication skills through public speaking, tutoring, client collaboration, and digital marketing.
      <br><br>
      Whether I’m writing content, sending client updates, or presenting findings, I strive to make my message clear, relevant, and impactful. I also value active listening and creating space for open conversation and feedback.
