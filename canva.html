    <h1>Canva</h1>
    <p>
      Canva is one of my favorite tools for visual content creation. I’ve used it to design everything from social media graphics and presentations to email banners and infographics — all while maintaining brand consistency and visual appeal.
      <br><br>
      I’ve created assets for internal newsletters, blog visuals, and promotional materials during my time at <strong>Montclair State University</strong>, <strong>Performance Max</strong>, and <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong>. I love how intuitive and efficient Canva is for turning ideas into professional-looking designs.
      <br><br>
      I’ve worked with both templates and custom layouts, and I enjoy experimenting with typography, color palettes, and design flow to create content that’s visually engaging and effective.
      <br><br>
      Whether it’s for social media posts, reports, or email campaigns — Canva always helps me deliver clean, consistent, and creative visuals.
