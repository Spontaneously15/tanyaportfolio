    <h1>Playhouse Preschool – Website Optimization</h1>
    <p>
      I worked on improving the user experience and content structure for Playhouse Preschool’s website. My goal was to make the site more welcoming, informative, and optimized for local search.
      <br><br>
      I restructured the homepage and services page, making the navigation easier for parents. I also helped with keyword placement, content rewriting, and improving call-to-actions across the site.
      <br><br>
      These changes resulted in increased time-on-page, lower bounce rate, and better usability for mobile users.
