    <h1>CreatedByLonna</h1>
    <p>
      I led a complete SEO overhaul for the CreatedByLonna website, which included both on-page and technical SEO strategies. I conducted keyword research, competitor analysis, and implemented optimizations across pages.
      <br><br>
      My work included improving title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and internal linking structures. I also fixed broken links, improved site speed, and made recommendations for alt text and mobile-friendliness.
      <br><br>
      This resulted in improved keyword rankings, increased site crawlability, and overall stronger presence in organic search.
