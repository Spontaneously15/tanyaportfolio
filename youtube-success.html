    <h1>YouTube Success – Channel Growth Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      I analyzed YouTube data across different channels using Tableau to understand what drives views, likes, and subscriber growth.
      <br><br>
      This project involved importing a large dataset, identifying top-performing content types, and comparing engagement across geographies. I used filters, heatmaps, and bar charts to showcase content performance by title length, upload frequency, and more.
      <br><br>
      This was one of my favorite Tableau projects — combining data visualization with marketing strategy to find patterns that help content creators grow their presence.
