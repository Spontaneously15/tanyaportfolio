    <h1>Google Analytics</h1>
    <p>
      Google Analytics has always been my go-to tool for measuring the performance of digital campaigns. It’s not only one of the most powerful tools in my digital marketing toolkit — it’s also my absolute favorite to work with.
      <br><br>
      I’ve used Google Analytics to track user behavior, page performance, and conversion funnels for multiple websites, including <strong>CreatedByLonna</strong>, <strong>Performance Max</strong>, and <strong>Zedplus Accounting & Finance</strong>. These insights helped guide data-driven SEO and content decisions that improved user engagement and ROI.
      <br><br>
      I'm also actively upskilling in this area by working toward a certification in <strong>Google Analytics 4 (GA4)</strong>, to master its advanced features and event-based tracking model.
