    <h1>Attention to Detail</h1>
    <p>
      Whether I’m reviewing content, performing keyword research, or debugging a formula in Excel — I take pride in noticing the small things that make a big difference. I double-check my work, stay organized, and care about quality.
      <br><br>
      My attention to detail has helped me avoid errors in SEO audits, keep branding consistent in Canva designs, and submit polished deliverables in both academic and professional settings.
