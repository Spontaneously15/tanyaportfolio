    <h1>Excel</h1>
    <p>
      Microsoft Excel has been one of the most practical and reliable tools in my personal, academic, and professional journey. I use it nearly every day — whether it's tracking job applications, planning projects, or analyzing data.
      <br><br>
      In my day-to-day life, I manage and organize my internship applications, networking status, and follow-ups using customized Excel trackers. It helps me stay consistent, focused, and intentional in my job search.
      <br><br>
      Academically, Excel has been a crucial tool in many of my college projects — from data visualization to optimization problems. I’ve used formulas, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and charts to present clean, insightful deliverables.
      <br><br>
      Professionally, I’ve used Excel for client reporting and data audits during my SEO and digital marketing roles. It helped me manage keyword lists, backlink strategies, and content calendars efficiently.
      <br><br>
      I’m also continuously expanding my skills in Excel by learning more about advanced functions, data cleaning, and using it alongside tools like Power BI and Python for deeper analysis.
