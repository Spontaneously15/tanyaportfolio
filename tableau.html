    <h1>Tableau</h1>
    <p>
      Tableau is one of my absolute favorite tools when it comes to data visualization. I love the creative flexibility it offers in turning raw data into insightful, interactive dashboards that actually tell a story.
      <br><br>
      Iâ€™ve created numerous dashboards and visual reports using Tableau for college projects, particularly in my Data Visualization and Business Analytics courses. From analyzing Airbnb listings to survey results and marketing performance, Iâ€™ve used Tableau to:
      <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block; margin-top: 15px;">
        <li>ðŸ“Š Build clean, interactive dashboards</li>
        <li>ðŸ“ˆ Use filters, parameters, and dynamic visuals</li>
        <li>ðŸŽ¯ Highlight key metrics like ROI, conversion rates, and customer behavior</li>
        <li>ðŸ’¡ Present storytelling-driven insights with confidence</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Iâ€™m constantly pushing myself to explore more features in Tableau, including calculated fields, LOD expressions, and storytelling dashboards that engage and inform decision-makers.
