    <h1>Time Management</h1>
    <p>
      Balancing multiple internships, classes, and personal projects has taught me how to prioritize tasks and manage my time effectively. I rely on digital planners, structured to-do lists, and proactive scheduling to stay on top of my commitments.
      <br><br>
      My ability to manage time has allowed me to consistently meet deadlines, avoid last-minute stress, and deliver high-quality work — whether it’s for SEO campaigns, internship tasks, or college assignments.
